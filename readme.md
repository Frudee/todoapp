# todoapp Project

Simple application to organazie your daily routine or shopping lists.
This project was made to demonstrate some of my skills. It does not use any external materials, i.e. educational videos, articles, etc.
Although, the idea of planning app is widely used, I was never satisfied with the provided functions, thus, decided to make my own.

Main features:

- 99% pure javasacript
- es6
- bootstrap 5
- parcel
- 3rd party libraries
- prototypal inheritance
- event delegation

- localstorage
